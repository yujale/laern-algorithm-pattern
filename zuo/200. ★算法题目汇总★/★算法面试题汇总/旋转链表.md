# 旋转链表

61.旋转链表

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/rotate-list/

给你一个链表的头节点 head ，旋转链表，将链表每个节点向右移动 k 个位置。

 
```
示例 1：


输入：head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
输出：[4,5,1,2,3]
示例 2：


输入：head = [0,1,2], k = 4
输出：[2,0,1]
 

提示：

链表中节点的数目在范围 [0, 500] 内
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0 <= k <= 2 * 109
```


Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k, shifts the list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list) by k positions, and returns its new head.

Shifting a Linked List means moving its nodes forward or backward and wrapping them around the list where appropriate. For example, shifting a Linked List forward by one position would make its tail become the new head of the linked list.

Whether nodes are moved forward or backward is determined by whether k is positive or negative.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in other words, the head will never be None / null.

```
Sample Input
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 // the head node with value 0
k = 2
Sample Output
4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 // the new head node with value 4
```
